################ ESP32 ################


-   Add listen on trigger topic for resending id and type

-   Implement OTA updates

-   Save water amount after every irrigation

-   Bluetooth connectivity for communicating ssid and pw

    #### DONE ####
    -   error logging needs to happen both through mqtt and locally in error_log.txt .
        insert function to send error_log.txt file through mosquitto if requested.

    -   Figure out a way to easily select the specific sensor folder 

################ RASPBERRY ################

-   Wifi usb module for immediate connectivity, in the ESP put a file with a preconfigured ssid and password.
    
-   If system reboots, send message to ESPs for asking names (to solve the error in which a new device is added before turning on the program)

-   When actuator esp is connected, immediately send on or off state according to the previous state (maybe after blackout)

-   Possibility to forget esp32 devices (from dictionary)

-   If a device present in the dictionary is not found, show error to user (with possibility to forget the esp)

-   Send datetime every day

-   Error handling for the callbacks

-   MQTT broker should require the appropriate access permissions.

################ GENERAL ################

-   if a method or function isnt ready for edgecases or needs error handling, comment it with       ### GENERAL TO HANDLE ### + reason why

-   MQTT communication should be encrypted in both raspberry and esp32.
